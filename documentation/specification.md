# Project specification

## Data structures and algorithms

- Minimax
- Alpha–beta pruning
- Game tree
- *TBD*

## Problem to solve

In this project, I am going to create a chess client that one can play against. The idea is to come up with approaches, including aforementioned algrorithms, that would allow the AI to make decision on what turn to make by evaluating the situation on the board. 


## Expected time and space complexities of the program

The alpha-beta pruning algorithm is expected to correspond to `O(b^(d/2))` time complexity.
