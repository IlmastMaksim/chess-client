# Implementation

## Project structure

- Basic commands are available at `README` file in the root directory 
- Source code can be found at `src` directory
- Tests can be found at `src/tests` directory
- Project split into modules `board`, `move`, `pieces`, `server` and `tables`.

## Implemented time and space complexities

The alpha-beta pruning algorithm is expected to correspond to `O(b^(d/2))` time complexity.

## Possible flaws and improvements
TBD
